# Backend - Trivia API

## Setting up the Backend

### Install Dependencies

1. **Python 3.7** - Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

2. **Virtual Environment** - We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

3. **PIP Dependencies** - Once your virtual environment is setup and running, install the required dependencies by navigating to the `/backend` directory and running:

- **Start and activate your virtual environment**

```bash
# Mac users
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows users
> py -3 -m venv venv
> venv\Scripts\activate
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Key Pip Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use to handle the lightweight SQL database. You'll primarily work in `app.py`and can reference `models.py`.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross-origin requests from our frontend server.

### Set up the Database

With Postgres running, create a `trivia` database:

```bash
createbd trivia
```

Populate the database using the `trivia.psql` file provided. From the `backend` folder in terminal run:

```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

### Run the Server

After successfully setting up and populating the database start your (backend) Flask server by running the command below from the `/backend/` directory.

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

These commands put the application in development and directs our application to use the `__init__.py` file in our flaskr folder. Working in development mode shows an interactive debugger in the console and restarts the server whenever changes are made. If running locally on Windows, look for the commands in the [Flask documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/factory/).

The application will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default and is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration. Also, the current version of the application does not require authentication or API keys.

## API Reference

### Getting Started

- Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration.
- Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys.

### Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:

```
{
  "success": False,
  "error": 400,
  "message": "Bad Request"
}

{
  "success": False,
  "error": 404,
  "message": "Resource Not Found"
}

```

The API will return four error types when requests fail:

- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 422: Not Processable
- 405: Method Not Allowed

## Testing

Write at least one test for the success and at least one error behavior of each endpoint using the unittest library.

To deploy the tests, run

```bash
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```
